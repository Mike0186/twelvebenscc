This website was designed as a content piece for the Twelve Bens Cycling Club to give prospective members an idea of what the club is about and what they do. Before this website the main source of information was issued over the clubs social media sites and whatsapp group. 

The site combines all three of clubs social network pages and allows the user to sign up to the clubs group chats. Users of the site will be able to quickly find their way around and get a tastes of the various cycles and what the club is about. 

The site is responsive accross all devices and is presented well on all screen sizes. The picture above was taken from [amiresponsive](https://amiresponsive.co.uk/)


# UI/UX
- The colour scheme for the site was derived from the logo. I used the colormind website and uploaded the logo.

# Future Features

-  I would like to include an online store to allow people to purchase cycling accessories and clothing. 

- Another feature would be to have a members login section. Once logged in the user would be able to purchase club merchandise also. 

- Finally a cycling blog with "how to" video tutorials. These could range from how to find the perfect bike, how to pick the correct size bike.

# Testing
- This site has been tested on the follwoing browsers; Chrome, Firefox and Micrsoft Edge.

- Through the various test I can confirm theat the dite is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes. 

- The form works and is fully validated and will not allow the user to proceed without completling all fields. The submit and refresh button work.

- The text contrast on all titles and links are all readable against the backgrounds.
