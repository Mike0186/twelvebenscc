![Twelve Bens Club Logo](/wireframe-images/twelvebenslogo2.jpg)

This website was designed as a content piece for the Twelve Bens Cycling Club to give prospective members an idea of what the club is about and what they do. Before this website the main source of information was issued over the clubs social media sites and whatsapp group. 

The site combines all three of clubs social network pages and allows the user to sign up to the clubs group chats. Users of the site will be able to quickly find their way around and get a tastes of the various cycles and what the club is about. 


# UI/UX
- The colour scheme for the site was derived from the logo. I used the colormind website and uploaded the logo.

- Another feature would be to have a members login section. Once logged in the user would be able to purchase club merchandise also. 

- Finally a cycling blog with "how to" video tutorials. These could range from how to find the perfect bike, how to pick the correct size bike.
