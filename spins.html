            <h2>Leisure Spin 30km</h2>
            <P>Leisure cycles are a steady introduction. You can use any type of bike for this cycle as
                it is not about speed just getting you used to the bike. The instructor will always try to bring
                you on a level spin so you donâ€™t have to climb as much. This can be hard in Connemara so it may not
                be a loop just out and back the same way. </P>

        <h2>Beginner Spin 30km +</h2>
        <P>The beginner route is the next step up it is advisable to have a road bike for this spin as it will
            be a little faster than the leisure. Along the route the instructor will introduce you to some tips
            and tricks for pedalling, hand & body position and formation cycling. These can seem complicated at
            first but will become second nature eventually. </P>

            <h2>Advanced Spin 60km +</h2>
            <P>This spin is not for the faint hearted. It is fast paced and you will need a high level of fitness to
                be able to keep up. The tips and trick you picked up in the beginner group will come into practice
                here. These spins can go up to 100km at an average speed of 30km/h.</P>
