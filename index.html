            About
        </h2>
        <p>
            The twelve bens cycling club operates out of Clifden county Galway. The club is in fact named after the
            Connemara mountain range and not because we have 12 members named Ben. The club has over 30 members from the
            area and we aim to meet up twice a week for training and attend different cycling events nationwide.<br><br>

            The twelve bens cycling club is for anyone who enjoys cycling or would like to get into it. There really is
            a spin for all levels. The club aims to have group cycles at least twice a week in the summer and once a
            week in the winter months. Once you get to know some people you may be able to set up cycles with other
            members at other times during the week.<br><br>

            The picturesque landscapes are a magnificent backdrop to your ride. The area is filled with routes for all
            levels of cyclist. Most of the routes are full loops so you can end up right where you started. You can even
            cycle the same routes as the tour de Conamara you can click the link <a href="https://tourdeconamara.ie"
